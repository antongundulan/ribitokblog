Rosalía’s parents are both Spanish, and she identifies as a person of white European descent. However, it is worth noting that Spain has a complex history of migration and colonization, and many Spaniards have mixed heritage that includes North African, Middle Eastern, or indigenous American ancestry.</p><h3><strong>Childhood and Family:</strong></h3><p>Rosalía grew up in a middle-class family in Sant Esteve Sesrovires. Her parents were supportive of her interest in music from a young age, and she began taking flamenco lessons at the age of 1She later studied at the Catalonia College of Music and the Superior School of Music of Catalonia in Barcelona. Her family has been a strong influence on her music, and she often dedicates her songs to them.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Personal Life:</strong></h3><p>Rosalía is known for being private about her personal life, but she has revealed that she is single and focused on her music career. She is active on social media, where she shares updates about her music and personal interests.

She has since released two more albums, “El Mal Querer” and “Motomami,” which have both been commercial and critical successes. Rosalía has won numerous awards, including five Latin Grammy Awards, and has collaborated with artists such as J Balvin, Travis Scott, and Billie Eilish.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h3><p>Rosalía is a talented singer and songwriter who has gained international recognition for her unique blend of traditional flamenco and modern pop and urban sounds. Her ethnicity and background have played a significant role in shaping her music, and she is proud of her Catalan and Andalusian heritage. As a Spaniard, she also represents the cultural richness of Spain, which has a long and diverse history.</p><p>Through her music, Rosalía has been able to connect with audiences around the world, regardless of their background or ethnicity. Her music is a celebration of the human experience, and she has been able to create a new style of music that is both innovative and authentic. Rosalía’s success has opened doors for other artists from Spain and Latin America, and she has become a cultural ambassador for her country and region.</p><p>Overall, Rosalía’s ethnicity is an important part of her identity, but it does not define her as an artist or person.
