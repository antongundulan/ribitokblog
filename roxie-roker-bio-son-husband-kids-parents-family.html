She was born in beautiful Miami, Florida to Bennie and Alfred Roker.&nbsp;It’s unknown if she grew up with a sibling, however, we do know that she was raised in Brooklyn and is a cousin of NBC TV host Al Roker.&nbsp;Roxie also spent part of her formative years in New York City before moving to Washington DC to further her education.&nbsp;She attended Howard University in Washington DC, where she was part of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority and part of the Howard Players.&nbsp;She earned a degree in fine arts.</span></p><p>After graduating, she returned to New York to pursue a career in acting.&nbsp;Well, fate initially had a different plan.&nbsp;First, she got a job in the NBC office in New York.&nbsp;While working for NBC, she would take every opportunity to work on stage.&nbsp;She worked for a while with the Negro Ensemble company, then began her professional acting career.&nbsp;Roxie has starred in plays like&nbsp;<span>Les Noirs, Ododo, Rosalee</span><span>&nbsp;among others.</span></p><p><span>She then worked as a television anchor at WNEW-TV in New York, where she hosted a show that explored events in Brooklyn called&nbsp;</span><span>Inside Bedford-Stuyvesant.&nbsp;</span><span>Roxie Roker continued acting and soon began starring in movies and TV shows.&nbsp;Today, she is best known for her role in the television series The Jefferson.</span></p><p>As well as being a presenter and actress, Roxie was also an activist.&nbsp;She has argued against child abuse and neglect.&nbsp;Unsurprisingly, she was a board member of the Interagency Council on Child Abuse and Neglect.&nbsp;Sadly, Roxie Roker was diagnosed with breast cancer and lost the battle for her life in 1995.</p><h2><strong><span>Family and relatives</span></strong></h2><p><span>Roxie Roker was born into the family of Bessie Mitchell and Alfred Roker.&nbsp;Bessie and Alfred existed when America was suffering from the scourge of racism.&nbsp;Bessie was a domestic worker while Alfred was a porter.&nbsp;They were a poor but loving family who felt it necessary to see to the good education of their child.&nbsp;Roxie went to school – from her basic education to tertiary level.&nbsp;Her mother is from Georgia and her father from the Bahamas.&nbsp;It is unknown if Roxie had a sibling, as there is no evidence to prove it.</span></p><h2><strong><span>husband, son, children</span></strong></h2><p><span>Roxie Roker is a mother of one and was married once before her death.&nbsp;She was married to filmmaker Sy Kravitz.&nbsp;It’s unclear when the couple met or when they started dating, but they married in 1962. Sy Kravitz is best known as a filmmaker and news producer for NBC.&nbsp;With Roxie he had a son, who is now a world famous artist and actor, Lenny Kravitz.&nbsp;His name comes from his father’s younger brother, Leonard, who died during the Korean War.&nbsp;Lenny has an interesting mix of races, he is of African, Jewish and Slavic descent.</span></p><p>The marriage between Roxie and Sy suffered a shipwreck due to the latter’s extramarital affairs.&nbsp;Eventually, the couple divorced in 1985, which strained the relationship between Sy and her only son with Roxie, Lenny.&nbsp;He (Sy Kravitz) died in 2005 of leukemia, but is said to have made peace with his son before leaving for the great beyond.</p><p><span>Lenny Kravitz is often referred to as a legendary musician, songwriter, music producer and occasional actor.&nbsp;He always had a flair for music and he started singing at the age of two and grew up singing.&nbsp;Lenny was married to Lisa Bonet, an established Hollywood actress.&nbsp;However, their marriage did not last long as it ended in divorce.&nbsp;Before the divorce, they had a daughter they called Zoe Kravitz.&nbsp;She is the granddaughter of Roxie Roker and also an aspiring actress.</span></p><h2><strong><span>What Was Roxie Roker’s Net Worth?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Before the death of this legendary actress, she featured in lots of TV shows as well as movies.&nbsp;This must have brought him considerable wealth.&nbsp;Apart from being an actress, she was also a news anchor and television host.&nbsp;As of 2019, it was unclear what his net worth was and there was no estimate of his worth till date.&nbsp;It is important to note that, during her lifetime, she was married to a well-to-do producer, Sy Kravitz, with whom she must have lived a luxurious life.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiqn622pnnRqKKeql2XtrB50qilZqClqK%2BiusNmoqKco2K9or7Ep6usZZaWuqq42Gg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2froxie-roker-bio-son-husband-kids-parents-family.html&text=Roxie%20Roker%20%20Bio%2c%20Son%2c%20Husband%2c%20Kids%2c%20Parents%2c%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2froxie-roker-bio-son-husband-kids-parents-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2froxie-roker-bio-son-husband-kids-parents-family.html&title=Roxie%20Roker%20%20Bio%2c%20Son%2c%20Husband%2c%20Kids%2c%20Parents%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2froxie-roker-bio-son-husband-kids-parents-family.html&title=Roxie%20Roker%20%20Bio%2c%20Son%2c%20Husband%2c%20Kids%2c%20Parents%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2froxie-roker-bio-son-husband-kids-parents-family.html&title=Roxie%20Roker%20%20Bio%2c%20Son%2c%20Husband%2c%20Kids%2c%20Parents%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2froxie-roker-bio-son-husband-kids-parents-family.html&description=Roxie%20Roker%20%20Bio%2c%20Son%2c%20Husband%2c%20Kids%2c%20Parents%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sandra-oh-net-worth-182869.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sandra Oh Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./prince-harry-meghan-markle-reaction-god-save-the-king-sung.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's reaction revealed as God Save the King is sung - watch">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
