He is widely regarded as one of the most original and significant composers of the twentieth century, sometimes referred to as a genius for his novel approaches to pop creation, outstanding musical aptitude, and mastery of recording techniques. His best-known work is notable for its high production standards, intricate harmonies and orchestrations, layered vocals, and contemplative or inventive themes. Wilson is also recognized for his formerly high-pitched singing voice and his longtime battle with mental illness.</p><p>He began his professional career in 1961 as a member of the Beach Boys, where he served as a songwriter, producer, co-lead vocalist, bassist, pianist, and de facto leader. He became the first pop musician to be credited with writing, arranging, producing, and singing his work after signing with Capitol Records in 1962. Other artists he produced included the Honeys and American Spring. By the mid-1960s, he had written or co-authored over two dozen Top 40 singles in the United States, including the number one “Surf City,” “I Get Around,” “Help Me, Rhonda,” and “Good Vibrations.” He is regarded as one of the first music producer auteurs and rock producers to use the studio as an instrument.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content"><span class=ez-toc-js-icon-con><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></span></a></span><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Brian_Wilson_Wiki_Biography_Wife_Age_Career_Net_Worth_Family></span><strong>Brian Wilson Wiki, Biography, Wife, Age, Career, Net Worth, Family</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table width=534><tbody><tr><td>Name</td><td>Brian Wilson</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>81 Year Old</td></tr><tr><td>Occupation</td><td>Singer, Songwriter</td></tr><tr><td>Date of Birth</td><td>20 June 1942</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Inglewood, California, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 feet 10 Inch</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>70 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Sibling</td><td>Not known</td></tr><tr><td>Wife Name</td><td>Marilyn Rovell, Melinda Kae Ledbetter</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Father Name</td><td>Not known</td></tr><tr><td>Mother Name</td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>15 USD million (Estimate)</td></tr><tr><td>Category</td><td><a href=#>Wiki</a></td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Brian_Wilson></span><strong>Who is Brian Wilson</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brian Wilson is a singer-songwriter, musician, composer, and producer.

Murry, the band’s manager at the time, canceled the band’s contract with the label. On October 1, 1962, the band signed with Capitol Records and released their debut album, ‘Surfin’ Safari,’ through them. It was a success, peaking at number 32 on the American charts.</p><p>In March 1963, the album ‘Surfin’ USA’ was published. It was their first RIAA Gold-certified album. Following this, they became a national sensation. Between 1963 and 1966, the Beach Boys issued eight more albums, including “Surfer Girl,” “Little Deuce Coupe,” “Shut Down Volume 2,” “All Summer Long,” “The Beach Boys’ Christmas Album,” and “The Beach Boys Today!” (1965). Wilson was awarded the Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for ‘Mrs. O’Leary’s Cow,’ as well as the Grammy for Best Historical Album for ‘The Smile Sessions.’</p><p>For years, the Beach Boys had struggled with a variety of challenges. Brian’s mental health has been worsening gradually. Dennis, his brother, died in 1983. The death of Carl Wilson in 1998 was the final nail in the coffin. The group simply disbanded.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Brian_Wilson_Wife></span><strong>Brian Wilson Wife</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Wilson was married to Marilyn Rovell from 1964 to 1979.

They met in 1986, but their relationship was cut short by Landy. Wilson reconnected with Ledbetter in 1992 and married three years later.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Net_Worth></span><strong>Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>His Net worth is more than 15 million USD.</p><p><strong>Social Media Profiles</strong></p><p><strong><a href=#>Facebook</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href=#>Twitter</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href=#>Instagram</a></strong></p><p>Brian Wilson is a famous American singer.
