The other part, the drug affected part, was not helping him.”</p><p>As Mr Lockwood began to appear threatening, security was required to restrain him, and he was given sedatives.</p><p>But about 20 minutes into the ordeal, Mr Lockwood appeared cyanotic and had no pulse.</p><p>CPR was administered, but he was later pronounced dead.</p><p>Mr Lockwood had been battling an addiction to methamphetamine for years, and had attempted to get clean many times between 2007 and 2019.</p><p>In 2018, Mr Lockwood had reconnected with an old childhood friend, who helped him gain employment as a pool technician.</p><p>He started going to the gym, and was extremely health conscious, as his new job required him to lift heavy weight, including bags of salt and chlorine drums.</p><p>But between mid 2018 and the start of 2019, Mr Lockwood‘s personal life deteriorated – he separated from his partner, lost his job with his friend and started drinking again.</p><p>About two weeks before his death, Mr Lockwood’s Narcotics Anonymous sponsor said Mr Lockwood had been using meth every day.</p><p>“This was the heaviest period that I have seen him using in the way he was,” he told the Coroners Court.</p><p>Despite Mr Lockwood’s struggle with his addiction, he had tried to overcome it many times, relying on support from family and friends.</p><p>On August 19, 2019, Mr Lockwood had taken more meth, and had started acting erratically.</p><p>A close friend saw Mr Lockwood had posted some concerning videos on his Instagram page, and contacted him to see if he was okay.</p><p>Mr Lockwood had really wanted to stay clean, and even told his friend he wanted a “normal life” before he died.</p><p>“All I want is to live; I just want a normal life and a job and a family,” Mr Lockwood had said.</p><p>An autopsy performed by Dr Melissa Thompson revealed his cause of death was methylamphetamine toxicity.</p><p>“It was reasonable to conclude that the struggle for over 20 minutes in a physical manner put further pressure on his already drug affected body and would have contributed to his death in this case,” Dr Thompson said.<br></p><p>Deputy State Coroner Erin Kennedy agreed the cause of death was meth toxicity, with antecedent causes relating to his resistance to restraint.</p><p>“Dane’s death highlights that significant changes are required for those who are brave enough and invested enough to seek help for serious drug addiction.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7zZqroqeelrlwutKwZJqbpGS6psDHZqysnaKoeqe1zZqjZqCfqr%2B0ecGenaiqlWLAtrDDnqVmnJWWwal7zZ6urGWjqbyzxY6dZ29plJeGcbKTn2hpb5KbfXqCj21wcG2Ul4R2g5JxnA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmeth-users-final-hours-before-sudden-death.html&text=Dane%20Oliver%20Lockwood%3a%20Meth%20users%20tragic%20final%20hours%20before%20sudden%20death&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeth-users-final-hours-before-sudden-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeth-users-final-hours-before-sudden-death.html&title=Dane%20Oliver%20Lockwood%3a%20Meth%20users%20tragic%20final%20hours%20before%20sudden%20death" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmeth-users-final-hours-before-sudden-death.html&title=Dane%20Oliver%20Lockwood%3a%20Meth%20users%20tragic%20final%20hours%20before%20sudden%20death" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmeth-users-final-hours-before-sudden-death.html&title=Dane%20Oliver%20Lockwood%3a%20Meth%20users%20tragic%20final%20hours%20before%20sudden%20death" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeth-users-final-hours-before-sudden-death.html&description=Dane%20Oliver%20Lockwood%3a%20Meth%20users%20tragic%20final%20hours%20before%20sudden%20death" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./amanda-davies-dead-soap-icon-erika-slezak-daughter-1235810372.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Daughter of Soap Icon Erika Slezak Was 42">&larr;
