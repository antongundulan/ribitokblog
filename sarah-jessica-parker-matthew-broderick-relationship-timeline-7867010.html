During their 26-year marriage, SJP and Broderick welcomed three children together — son James and twin daughters Marion and Tabitha.

Ahead of their debut on stage, SJP gushed to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Los Angeles Times</a> about her co-star boyfriend, telling the outlet: "He's probably the funniest fellow I've met in my whole life.
