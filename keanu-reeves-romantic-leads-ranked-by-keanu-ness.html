(It was hard, thankless labor, which we undertook for purely selfless reasons.).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Why do we love Keanu? Perhaps because it's so refreshing to find a handsome man who has been in the game for as long as he has and still maintained his reputation of being a straight-up Good Guy. There are no #MeToo scandals, no past racist tweets — just an earnest actor living his life and doing good deeds for his fans. It’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>breathtaking</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He’s also a weirdo, and internet culture loves a weirdo.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Thus, we’ve taken it upon ourselves to rank seven of his most-memorable romantic films on an arbitrary point scale based on what we’re calling Keanu-ness — that intangible, elusive quality that makes Keanu, Keanu. We hope you enjoy it as much as you enjoy these most Keanu cinematic treasures.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-feeling-minnesota-1996></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Feeling Minnesota (1996)</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Character: </strong>Jiaks Clayton</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Love Interest: </strong>Cameron Diaz as former stripper Freddie</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Keanu-ness Score: </strong>6/10</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Facial Hair Status: </strong>5 O'clock shadow.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Watch for</strong>: A very young Keanu and Cameron Diaz.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's your classic cheesy '90s romcom starring a young, short-haired Keanu and Cameron Diaz who play star-crossed lover looking to escape their current reality in Minnesota. Although the film was a flop in critics' eyes (it has a measly 14% on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Rotten Tomatoes</a>), it still possesses that Keanu charm we've all come to know and love. -Tessa Petak</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sweet-november-2001></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Sweet November (2001)</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Character</strong>: Nelson Moss</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Love interest: </strong>Charlize Theron as “free-spirited dog walker” Sara Deever</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Keanu-ness Score:</strong> 1/10</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Facial hair status</strong>: American Psycho-level smoothness</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Watch for</strong>: Keanu poorly serenading Charlize Theron in a full tuxedo.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is the kind of movie you could only find in the year 2001. Keanu stars as Nelson Moss, a workaholic ad exec (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Ben Barry </a>vibes?) who meets quirky pet lady (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Polly Prince</a> vibes?) on the verge of a nervous breakdown (literally every rom-com in the early-aughts vibes?).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The premise is stranger than the melodramatic, romance-novel-esque movie poster would lead you to believe: Free spirit Sara takes messed-up men into her unrealistically large San Francisco apartment for a month at a time to help them learn how to enjoy their lives, and Keanu’s Nelson just happens to be her ideal candidate for the month of November after he’s fired from his high-powered job, and his girlfriend Angelica (an underused Lauren Graham) breaks up with him.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Charlize’s Sara really exudes the most Keanu energy here with her unconventional “freak” antics, as she teaches Nelson to live in the moment and also to know the gift of dogs. (There are so many dogs.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the landscape of Keanu’s films, Nelson is perhaps one of the most un-Keanu-like characters — basically, he’s an asshole with no morals. Despite an incredible character arc that finishes with Mr. Reeves delivering a log of salami to his beloved (a Very Keanu move), we hate to see our man so literally buttoned up, even if for just the first third of the film. — Sam Reed</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-destination-wedding-2018></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Destination Wedding (2018)</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Character:</strong> Frank</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Love interest: </strong>Winona Ryder as Lindsay, the anxious wedding guest watching her ex tie the knot</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Keanu-ness Score:</strong> 3/10</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Facial hair status:</strong> Fully bearded</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Watch for:</strong> Reeves and Ryder's chemistry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It seems impossible to round up Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder, icons of the '90s and the present day, and make a boring movie. Destination Wedding, however, achieves the impossible. As the cynical Frank, Reeves’s Keanu-ness is toned down in favor of biting negativity, but being that he is Keanu Reeves, his charm still shines through. What makes up for the movie, though, is that its press tour gave us the gift of finding out that Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder might technically be married to each other. — Kimberly Truong</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-lake-house-2006></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Lake House (2006)</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Character</strong>: Alex Wyler</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Love interest</strong>: Sandra Bullock as the over-worked and under-apprecated Dr. Kate Forrester</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Keanu-ness Score</strong>: 5/10</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Facial hair status</strong>: L.L.

There isn't much room for Keanu’s eccentric nature to shine through, but damn if he doesn’t look good in a thick turtleneck sweater. His vulnerability — another key Keanu trait — is what really stands out and makes him believable as the romantic lead in a long distance (in years, that is) relationship with Sandra Bullock’s lonely Kate and her questionable 2006 haircut. (Sorry, Sandra.) — S.R.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-private-lives-of-pippa-lee-2009></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Private Lives of Pippa Lee (2009)</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Character:</strong> Chris Nadeau</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_80-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Love interest:</strong> Robin Wright as Pippa Lee, a housewife with a dark past on the edge of a nervous breakdown</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_82-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Keanu-ness Score</strong>: 8/10</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_84-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Facial hair status</strong>: Clean shaven but in a ‘90s alt rock lead singer way</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_86-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Watch for:</strong> Keanu’s collar bone-to-pelvis chest tattoo of Jesus.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_88-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The only thing that makes up for the lack of Keanu screen-time is the stacked cast. And just when you thought nothing could be more sensational than Julianne Moore playing the exploitative artist girlfriend of young Pippa’s (Blake Livley's) closeted Aunt (Robin Weigert), you find out that the whole project was produced by <i>Brad Pitt</i>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_90-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though this film is primarily about the evolution of the titular Pippa Lee (or her “private lives,” if you will), don’t worry — there’s plenty of Big Keanu Energy to go around when the actor does turn up onscreen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_92-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keanu plays Chris, the “half-baked” divorced son of Pippa’s neighbors in the retirement community she moved to after her esteemed publisher husband’s third heart attack. As their vast age difference begins to wear on her marriage, Chris emerges as the eccentric, failed clergyman-turned-staunch atheist foil to everyone in her tightly controlled life. Nothing illustrates this “savior” complex more than the scene in which Pippa stumbles across Chris in a random street, bending over a random dog who had just been hit by a car. When the camera pans across the deeply empathetic Chris, stroking the dying pup’s head as the music swells — I really felt that. — S.R.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-somethings-gotta-give-2003></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_94-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Something’s Gotta Give (2003)</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_97-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Character: </strong>Julian Mercer</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_99-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Love interest:</strong> Diane Keaton as Erica Barry, a romantically frustrated playwright</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_101-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Keanu-ness Score:</strong> 9/10</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_103-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Facial hair status:</strong> Gone, but not forgotten</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_105-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Watch for:</strong> Keanu Reeves telling Diane Keaton that she's "incredibly sexy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_107-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We’ll come right out and say it: Something’s Gotta Give could not be made in the year 2019, because people (myself included) would riot over Diane Keaton’s character choosing Jack Nicholson's character — a man she meets because he is initially dating her young daughter — over Keanu Reeves's. Not only does he look like Keanu Reeves, Julian is a doctor who respects her ambitions as a playwright, and who does things like kiss her on the neck at dinner and say, “I knew you’d smell good.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_109-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not to mention, after her brief, torrid affair with Jack Nicholson’s character (during which she ghosts Julian), Erica is reunited with Julian when her sister spots him at a farmer’s market, of all places. He then comes to her house with a bouquet of hand-picked (presumably locally grown) flowers, joking, “These are for you to give me when you apologize.” We love an eco-friendly, forgiving man! — K.T.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-walk-in-the-clouds-1995></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_111-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A Walk in the Clouds (1995)</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_114-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Character:</strong> Paul Sutton</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_116-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Love interest:</strong> Aitana Sánchez-Gijón as Victoria Aragon, the traveler returning home to her family vineyard</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_118-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Keanu-ness Score:</strong> 10/10</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_120-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Facial hair status:</strong> Non-existent</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_122-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Watch for: </strong>Keanu Reeves in a white tank, dancing with fake wings.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_124-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Perhaps the most sweeping romance of Keanu’s onscreen romances, A Walk in the Clouds is also peak Keanu. His character spends the movie defending a woman from a creep on the bus, falling in love with said woman, dancing with her among a line of fiery torches, and, at one point, taking off his flannel shirt to try to tame the flames that have engulfed her family’s vineyards. — K.T.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-always-be-my-maybe-2019></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_126-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Always Be My Maybe (2019)</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_129-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Character:</strong> Keanu Reeves</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_131-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Love interest:</strong> Ali Wong as Sasha Tran, a successful, ambitious chef</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_133-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Keanu-ness Score: </strong>20/10</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_135-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Facial hair status:</strong> Perfectly stubbled</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_137-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Watch for: </strong>Keanu's entrance, soundtracked by AWOLNATION's "Sail."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_139-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As the movie that kickstarted the Keanussance of 2019, it makes sense that Netflix’s rom-com of the summer features Reeves’s essence dialed up all the way to the max.
