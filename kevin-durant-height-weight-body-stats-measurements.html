Don’t confuse him with actor Kevin Durand, it’s another “Kevin” for another day.&nbsp;Let us get in touch with our inner sports being today by discovering the famous basketball player.&nbsp;Before we go into details about Kevin Durant’s height and other distinctive stats, here is some information about him.</span></p><p><span>Well, let’s just say his basketball career started shortly before joining the NBA, he played two years of high school basketball at the National Christian Academy and one year at Oak Hill Academy, before transferring to the Montrose Christian School in its senior year.&nbsp;Even then it was obvious he was destined for big things, he was considered the second best prospect for high school in 2006.</span></p><p><span>It wasn’t long before he started his college career that he officially declared his draft for the 2007 NBA draft and since then he’s been a consecutive success.</span></p><h2><span>Kevin Durant’s</span></h2><p><span>It’s an easy game, the basketball player is incredibly tall, so tall that in his senior year of high school he was already towering at 6ft 7in.&nbsp;This obviously means that it has grown over the years.&nbsp;Despite the glaring fact that Durant’s height is one of his defining characteristics, there has been much speculation that, like a handful of other NBA players, he is not too honest about its size.</span></p><p><span>This one is a first time guy, apparently the athlete is actually bigger than he says.&nbsp;That’s news, we usually have people going in the opposite direction.&nbsp;No, he’s not ashamed of it, the fact is that Durant’s height needs to be minimized for him to play his part.&nbsp;He is listed as 6ft 9in but is actually 6ft 11in tall.</span></p><p><span>Here’s what he had to say on the subject to The Wall Street Journal’s Chris Herring, “But I really thought it was cool to say I’m a 6-9 small forward, really, that’s the typical size of a small forward.&nbsp;Anything bigger than that, and they’ll start by saying, “Ah, that’s a powerful forerunner.”&nbsp;The rules of the game have changed since he arrived, but we think old lies die hard.</span></p><p><span>He also said, “For me, when I talk to women, I’m 7 feet, in basketball circles I’m between 6-9.&nbsp;Celebrities who share Kevin Durant’s height, the real one, are Tim Duncan, Kevin Darnett and Dwight Howard.</span></p><p><span>See also: Height, weight and measurements of Arnold Schwarzenegger</span></p><h2><span>Weight of Kevin Durant</span></h2><p><span>With all that height, you better believe a lot of weight, but not in a bad way though, taller people are actually heavier than their shorter counterparts.&nbsp;Either way, there’s quite a story here, and it just goes to show how unhappy we are as human beings.&nbsp;When Durant was first drafted into the NBA, he was pretty “slender.”&nbsp;OK, we’ll say it, he was skinny.</span></p><p><span>The media made noise, the fans made noise, the words, he must grow.&nbsp;If he gained weight, he would be unstoppable!&nbsp;were often used.&nbsp;When he finally put on a few pounds, he suffered an injury that kept him out of action for an entire season.&nbsp;So that was an unfortunate turn of events, and now a majority of people are complaining about what he accumulated.</span></p><p><span>He currently weighs 109 kg and he is not overweight or underweight in any way.&nbsp;Everyone knows that as an athlete, it would be foolish not to follow a structured diet and training program.&nbsp;Durant has one and most of his routines are designed to build both mobility and strength.</span></p><p><span>Not only does he train, but he eats well, before his games he goes for fish and vegetables to fuel his stamina, then indulges in something heartier, like steak or chicken with rice.&nbsp;Fruit, water, and complex carbohydrates (oats, for example) are also a regular part of his diet, and he takes plenty of yogurt to stock up on good bacteria.</span></p><p><span>See Also: Jennifer Aniston’s Nose Job, House, Legs & Diet</span></p><h2><span>Kevin Durant body stats and measurements</span></h2><p><span>We can’t just leave things to Kevin Durant’s height and weight, we also have some other stats here for you.&nbsp;His chest is 43 inches, his waist is 35 inches, and his biceps are 15 inches.</span></p><p><span>In addition, the athlete wears a size 16, a European size and a size 15.5.&nbsp;We can’t imagine how difficult it must have been to find shoes before he became famous, but everything is going well now.</span></p><p
