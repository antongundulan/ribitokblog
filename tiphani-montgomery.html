As per NY Post, Tiphani said in her statement that:-</p><p>The message that I delivered under the instruction of God at my event and to my audience was a warning to wake up and pay attention. Art creates! We as Christians and as Believers have no business watching, listening to supporting any artist who knows draws from the occult to create.”</p><p>Her music, her videos, her messaging is witchcraft. Plain and simple. Had the message not been about one who many have given ‘idol’ status to, no one would have much to say.
