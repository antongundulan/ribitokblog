look.&nbsp;The “Hey, my private life is awesome” look.&nbsp;To find out if his life is as bright as we hope it is, it’s time to meet Tom Hardy’s wife and son.&nbsp;We hope they will give us some insight.</span></p><p>See also: Wiz Khalifa’s Son Wife Sister Girlfriend Mom</p><h2><span>Tom Hardy’s wife</span></h2><p><span>Bringing up this topic isn’t going to be as easy as you think, for no reason other than the fact that the actor is currently at wife number two, so before we take a look at the actor the actor is jostling with currently, it is best to check the first woman who has the title.&nbsp;of Tom Hardy’s wife.</span></p><h3><span>Tom Hardy’s wife;&nbsp;Sarah Ward</span></h3><p><span>At a time when Tom still believed in love at first sight, he met Sarah Ward.&nbsp;It was 1999 and it was a real romance in every sense of the word, as they got married three weeks after they met.&nbsp;The two got married quite young and you know how everything seems like a really good idea at that time.</span></p><p><span>Well their marriage was a marriage that couldn’t stand the test of time, or in their case, drug tests and alcohol tests…wait and more drug tests.&nbsp;Yeah folks, if you haven’t figured it out yet, Sarah had a serious drug and alcohol problem, and her name was Tom Hardy.</span></p><p><span>So after living together as husband and wife from 1999 to 2004, the couple decided to forgo their doomed marriage… if Jack and Rose abandoned their sinking ship as fast as Hardy and his ex,&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Titanic</span></strong><span>&nbsp;would have had a whole different type of love story.</span></p><p>Kudos to Tom, though, he bounced back and got sober around 2003, so his marriage was a stepping stone for him.</p><h3><span>Tom Hardy’s wife;&nbsp;Charlotte Riley</span></h3><p><span>After his marriage fell apart, Tom moved out and started dating Rachael Speed, the couple have a son together and Tom is still very much in his child’s life.&nbsp;His current wife is none other than Charlotte Riley, and the actress he starred with in the British film adaptation of&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Wuthering Heights</span></strong></p><p><span>For those who don’t know, the movie was shot in 2009 and the couple got engaged a year later.&nbsp;They also starred together in the television series&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Peaky Blinders</span></strong><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>Now on to the juicy stuff.&nbsp;The couple married in a secret ceremony on the weekend of July 4, 2014 in an 18-century castle in Provence.</span></p><p><span>A source confirmed this two months later, telling&nbsp;</span><strong><span>The Sun</span></strong><span>&nbsp;“It was a beautiful, low-key day, made even more special because they just had their closest friends and family around them.”</span></p><p><span>At the end of 2015 they revealed that they had their first child together, it came as a surprise as they kept it a secret and soon after congratulations were in order.&nbsp;They do a good job protecting the child from the public eye.</span></p><p>See also: Channing Tatum’s House, Divorce, and Teeth</p><h2><span>Tom Hardy’s teeth</span></h2><p><span>If you’ve ever seen him smile, you know what we’re about today.&nbsp;The actor has a lot of crooked teeth, but that doesn’t stop him from flashing his jaw-dropping smile every once in a while.&nbsp;There are rumors that he’s corrected his teeth a bit since his&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Star Trek</span></strong><span>&nbsp;days, and whitened them a bit too.</span></p><p><span>Nevertheless, he still has a bit of “crookedness” and while some fans want him to fix them, others don’t care about his teeth.&nbsp;In their opinion, teeth are perfectly imperfect.&nbsp;We’ll let you judge for yourself.</span></p><h2><span>Tom Hardy’s son</span></h2><p><span>As we mentioned earlier, Tom has a son from a previous relationship.&nbsp;Louis Tom Hardy was born in 2008, while Tom was working with his former girlfriend, Rachel Speed.&nbsp;The actress’ current wife, Charlotte Riley, described Louis as “the most amazing, smartest, most creative little human being I’ve ever met.”</span></p><p><span>Tom also said that becoming a father really set Himself on a straight course, he admitted that becoming a father was the only thing that saved him from the addiction to drinks and drugs that threatened to ruin his life.&nbsp;So we have little Louis to thank for being a driving force in his father’s life.</span></p><h2><span>Tom Hardy’s Tattoos</span></h2><p><span>Like most people within reach, Tom Hardy started getting tattoos to express himself.&nbsp;So we have compiled a list of Tom Hardy tattoos for you.</span></p><p><span>He has a “Padre fiero” tattoo which means “fierce father” on his left collarbone, comedy and tragedy masks with the phrase “Smile Now, Cry Later”, “Till I die SW” inked on his stomach for his now ex -wife Sarah Ward, and a large tribal tattoo on the right shoulder.</span></p><p><span>He also has a Fighting Irishman inked on his right arm which he got when he was 15, in honor of his mother’s legacy, ‘Figlio mio bellissimo’ encircling his right arm meaning my son-in-law and also has a tattoo of the Virgin Mary on his left arm, discovered that his then-girlfriend, Rachael Speed, was pregnant.</span></p><p><span>With so many tattoos, it’s a surprise he’s only got bare skin left, don’t think we’re done, there’s more ink left to list.&nbsp;He has a “Lindy King” tattoo on his left arm and he promised his longtime agent that he would get his name tattooed if he got him into Hollywood.</span></p><p><span>He has a dragon tattoo on his left arm that he was inked on for Sarah Ward, who was born in the year of the dragon and that pretty much sums it all up.</span></p><p class=postsid
