on October 28, 1978, in Columbus, <a href=#>Georgia</a>, Justin was raised in the Philadelphia, PA, suburb of Doylestown.</p><p>His father, Eldrin Bell, is a former Georgia Chief of Police and is African American.</p><p>Justin's mother, Kathy Pepino Guarini, was a journalist for WTVM TV in Columbus, and later for CNN.</p><p>He was primarily raised by his mother and his step-father, Jerry Guarini.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Now, 20 years after his <a href=#>American Idol</a> debut, Justin has created a life for himself that he is happy about.</p><h2 id=putting-in-the-work><strong>PUTTING IN THE WORK</strong></h2><p>Justin joined boys choirs throughout his time in school and even became the lead vocalist in an acapella group called The Midnight Voices.</p><p>He also took on lead roles in numerous high school and college plays.</p><p>During that time, the singer also learned to play the guitar, piano, and banjo.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Justin attended the University of the Arts, where he took up vocal performance and theater studies.</p><p>After graduating, he moved to <a href=#>New York City</a> and enrolled in the School for Film and Television.</p><p>There he worked in nightclubs and auditioned for theater roles.</p><h2 id=becoming-an-idol><strong>BECOMING AN IDOL</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000727090924.jpg><p>In 2002, Justin's life changed forever when he turned down a role in The Lion King to audition for American Idol.</p><p>The judges were very impressed with his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">audition</a> and couldn't believe he was still undiscovered.</p><p>In the end, Justin became the runner-up on the first season of the competition show, losing to <a href=#>Kelly Clarkson.</a></p><p>Coming in second jumpstarted his singing career and made him go down in Idol history as one of the greats.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000617791019.jpg><p>After Idol, Justin signed with 19 Management and secured a record deal with RCA.</p><h2 id=from-idol-to-albums><strong>FROM IDOL TO ALBUMS</strong></h2><p>About one year after his time on the singing show, Justin released his debut, self-titled album.</p><p>It also happened to coincide with the season 2 finale and the release of the movie, From Justin to Kelly.</p><p>Sadly, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">film did not receive great ratings from critics.</a></p><p>Aside from From Justin To Kelly, he has also starred in Fast Girl, Forgotten Son, Wizards of Waverly Place, Blaze and the Monster Machines, and independent films.</p><p>That same year, he was dropped from RCA.</p><p>In 2004, he starred in the pre-Broadway presentation of Good Vibrations <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">but turned down the chance to star in the Broadway production.</a></p><p>Wanting to continue his singing career, Justin independently released his second album, Stranger Things Have Happened Here.</p><h2 id=on-air-duties-and-an-ep><strong>ON-AIR DUTIES AND AN EP</strong></h2><p>Taking a break from releasing music, Justin became a co-host for Idol tonight and Idol Wrap from 2007 to 2011.</p><p>He appeared on other TV guide network shows, hosted movie premieres, and provided on-air coverage of award shows.</p><p>Then, in 2008, the theater actor released a three-song EP titled Revolve, which was co-written by Shaun Ingram.</p><p>One year later, Justin kept up with his public appearances by attending the grand opening of The American Idol Experience at Disney's Hollywood Studios.</p><h2 id=forming-relationships><strong>FORMING RELATIONSHIPS</strong></h2><p>Although Justin has moved on, he did confirm in 2014, during his one-man show, Lovesick, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">that he and Kelly dated for a short time</a>, which started on the set of From Justin to Kelly.</p><p>Their relationship did not last due to her career taking off.</p><p>They were best friends throughout their time on the show and have remained friends to this day, with Justin <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">making an appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show in 2019.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000727090905.jpg><p>But while Justin was at the American Idol Experience, he confirmed his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">impending marriage</a> to his fiancée, Reina Capodici at that time.</p><p>They married a few months later in September 2009.</p><p>In 2011, he and Reina welcomed their first child together, a son named William Neko Bell Guarini.</p><p>Then in 2013, his wife gave birth to their second son, whom they named Asher.</p><p>Although he did live in Los Angeles for many years, Justin confirmed to Visit Bucks County that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he moved back home</a> to raise his family.</p><h2 id=turning-to-broadway><strong>TURNING TO BROADWAY</strong></h2><p>Justin turned his focus from albums to performing live and took to stage and film acting.</p><p>He made his Broadway debut in 2010 in Women on the Edge of a Nervous Breakdown.</p><p>From there, Justin went on to star in American Idiot, Romeo and Juliet, Wicked, Rent, Chicago, Company, and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, as well as many others.</p><p>His latest theater role was in 2016 and he is still active in the community.</p><p>He attended the 2016 Tony Awards, where he co-hosted backstage coverage of the live show.</p><h2 id=televisions-ads-and-more><strong>TELEVISIONS ADS AND MORE</strong></h2><p>While continuing his career with the Broadway community, Justin is now focused on his family and has turned to TV commercials.</p><p>Since 2015, the now 43-year-old has played <a href=#>Lil' Sweet in the Diet Dr. Pepper commercials</a> and web marketing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000723684293.jpg><p>The following year, iTunes promoted an album for the commercial mascot with video clips, promotional pictures, and a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter page for the character.</a></p><p>Releasing music for Lil' Sweet inspired him to make music again.</p><p>Via PledgeMusic, Justin released his 17-track EP, JG, in 2016.</p><p>Aside from Lil' Sweet, Justin has continued to act, with his last two roles in 2018 and 2019.</p><p>The musician released a book in 2019 called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Audition Secrets</a>.</p><p>He also played Prince Charming in the 2021 regional show, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Once Upon a One More Time</a>, the <a href=#>Britney Spears</a> Jukebox Musical.</p><p>Justin recently appeared on the American Idol 20th anniversary episode on May 2, 2022.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Justin performs in the Philadelphia Thanksgiving Parade from time to time and
