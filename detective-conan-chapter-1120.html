The treasure was supposedly hidden in a secret room that could only be opened by four priests, each holding a key with a different symbol. However, the priests were actually hired actors, and the treasure was actually a trap set by Kuroda to lure Kaito Kid, the notorious phantom thief who had announced his intention to steal it.</p><p>The chapter began with Conan and his friends exploring the mansion, while Kuroda and his assistant watched them from a monitor. Kuroda explained that he had installed cameras and microphones all over the mansion, and that he had also prepared a special surprise for Kaito Kid. He then revealed that he had hired a professional sniper to shoot Kid if he ever showed up, and that he had also rigged the secret room with explosives that would detonate if anyone tried to open it without the correct keys.</p><p>Meanwhile, Conan and his friends encountered the four priests, who introduced themselves as Father Brown, Father Doyle, Father Chesterton, and Father Christie. They claimed that they were guarding the treasure, and that they would only open the secret room if Kaito Kid appeared. Conan noticed that each priest had a different symbol on their key, and that they matched the symbols on the four paintings in the mansion. He also noticed that the paintings were actually clues to the location of the secret room, and that they were based on the works of famous mystery writers, such as Agatha Christie, Arthur Conan Doyle, G.K. Chesterton, and R. Austin Freeman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Detective-Conan-Chapter-1120-release-date.jpg><p>Conan then deduced that the secret room was behind the fireplace in the living room, and that the four keys had to be inserted into the four holes on the wall above the fireplace. He also realized that Kaito Kid was already in the mansion, disguised as one of the priests. He then tried to warn the others, but it was too late, as Kaito Kid revealed himself and snatched the keys from the other priests. He then inserted the keys into the holes, and opened the secret room, only to find a painting of Mona Lisa with a mustache and a message from Kuroda, mocking him for falling into his trap.</p><p>The chapter ended with Conan finding the body of Father Brown, who was stabbed in the chest with a knife. He also noticed that Heiji, who had accompanied him to the mansion, was missing, and wondered if he was kidnapped by the murderer. He then decided to solve the case, and to find Heiji, before it was too late.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_To_Read></span><strong>Where To Read</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Detective Conan chapter 1120 can be read online on the official platforms that have the license to publish the manga in different languages and regions.
